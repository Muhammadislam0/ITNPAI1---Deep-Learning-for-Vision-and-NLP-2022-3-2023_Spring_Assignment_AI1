        " - The standard project recommendation is to focus on recognizing cars or trees, which are easier to identify and annotate. Other objects or phenomena can be adopted, but are subject to prior approval by the module instructor (Jefersson A. dos Santos). **It is not allowed to assemble datasets containing people. Other sensitive patterns, such as license plates, must be properly hidden.**\n",
        " - Don't panic! We are aware that acquiring images _in situ_ is an impediment for most students. The dataset can be assembled with images collected remotely or from public repositories. Just be careful with rights and permissions for using images found on the internet. Anyway, these factors must be taken into account for the problem definition.\n",
        " - Think of interesting problems, but that are easy to assemble an image dataset. Although we encourage you to do interesting and engaging work, it shouldn't be too complex or time-consuming. Try to appropriately scale the time required for this step.
